Windows Hibernate Countdown
===========================

Windows Hibernate Countdown (WHC) allows you to use Python to schedule your Windows computer to hibernate after a given amount of time. This functionality is not provided by the standard `shutdown` Windows command (although there are a number of workarounds).

You will need Python 2.x installed on your computer to use WHC.

Documentation
-------------

WHC is designed for use from command-line (e.g., Command Prompt or PowerShell).

Once in the WHC directory, load `hibernate.py` using the command `python hibernate.py`, then follow the on-screen instructions.
